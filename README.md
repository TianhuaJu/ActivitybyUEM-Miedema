Notes: (1) In some previous calculation, parameter for C is modified
which is from the " Statiscal Thermodynamics of Alloys" by N. A. Gokcen. In this program. default is from the Miedema's original paper.
(2) Calculation of property difference in Non-interactive method is redefined for non-metalic system, 
mainly difference occured in the system which the consituent to be dealt before trans it into metal state
